# The Legend of Koma

The Legend of Koma is my attempt to create a game for the Atari 2600. It's my first foray into the world of assembly and low level programming. Coming from strictly web developing background, I felt the urgency to expand my horizon, looking at different topics.

The game is compiled with the [DASM Assembler](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/), tested with the [Stella Emulator](https://stella-emu.github.io/).

Special thanks to [Gustavo Pezzi](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-assembly-language-programming-atari-2600-games) for making this possible.
