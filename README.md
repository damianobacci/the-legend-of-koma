# The Legend of Koma

The Legend of Koma is my attempt to create a game for the Atari 2600. It's my first foray into the world of assembly and low level programming. Coming from strictly web developing background, I felt the urgency to expand my horizon, looking at different topics.

The game is compiled with the [DASM Assembler](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/), tested with the [Stella Emulator](https://stella-emu.github.io/).

Special thanks to [Gustavo Pezzi](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-assembly-language-programming-atari-2600-games) and [Oscar Toledo G.](https://amzn.to/3TLshM2) for making this possible, the game has comments based on the course and the book.

## Info (to complete)

- The game runs in NTSC format
- Racing the beam, what is this concept?
- Different parts of the 6507 processor
